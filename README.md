# Introduction

Contributors to this repo are [Zachary Christoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-christoff-485b7466/) and myself.

The purpose of this repository is to offer guidance / instruction on how to secure specific tables in a Fabric Lakehouse so that a subset of users can access only those tables and not have access to entire Lakehouse on the Target Path.

This scenario came up repeatedly across customers and we decided to publicly document the steps we have taken to achieve this scenario.

It is also important to note, that when utilizing a medallion Lakehouse model, wee also recommend not putting everything in one workspace.  A good foundation to work with is the following...

Depending on your scenario, you may need to deviate from this but this is a good place to get started and then adjust as needed.
